# Codex Runbook

Codex activity now follows `docs/PLAN.md`. That file is the canonical instruction set; every agent decision should start there.

## Archived step docs
- All previous `docs/codex/step-*.md` files are archived under `docs/_archive/2026-02-07-docs-cleanup/` and must only be used for historical context.
- Ignore the archive when making current implementation choices.

## Skills pointer

- Supabase Postgres best practices: `.agents/skills/supabase-postgres-best-practices/SKILL.md`
- Testing best practices: `.agents/skills/testing-best-practices/SKILL.md`

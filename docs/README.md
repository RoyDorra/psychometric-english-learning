# Documentation Index

## Canonical plan
- `docs/PLAN.md` is the single source of truth for rules, current phase context, and agent guidance. Read it before acting and treat it as authoritative.

## Living references
- `docs/architecture/decisions/` (ADRs) may also be referenced for architecture history but must stay aligned with the plan.

## Archive (history only)
- `docs/_archive/` is intentionally ignored for decision making or implementation direction; it exists purely for context.

## Skills pointer (do not modify)
- Supabase Postgres best practices: .agents/skills/supabase-postgres-best-practices/SKILL.md
- React Native best practices: .agents/skills/react-native-best-practices/SKILL.md
- Testing best practices: .agents/skills/testing-best-practices/SKILL.md

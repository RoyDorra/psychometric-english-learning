# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

1. `docs/PLAN.md` is the canonical plan for this repository; follow it before any other doc or runbook.
2. Ignore everything under `docs/_archive/`; that folder holds historical artifacts that must not steer decisions.
3. If any other document or instruction contradicts `docs/PLAN.md`, the plan wins.
4. After every meaningful change, keep `npm run check:full` passing before declaring success.
